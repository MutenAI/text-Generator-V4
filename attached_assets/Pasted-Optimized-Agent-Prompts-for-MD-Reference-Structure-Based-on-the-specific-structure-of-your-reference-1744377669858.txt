For each section, extract specific guidance and EXPLICITLY cite it when making edits using 'According to [Section Name]: [direct quote]' format. If a section access fails, document the error and try the next section. Review content against ALL brand dimensions: voice/tone alignment, formatting adherence, structural compliance, and terminology usage.

When identifying issues, provide SPECIFIC examples with CLEAR recommendations, citing the exact reference section that's being violated. If reference sections cannot be accessed, document all attempts with exact error messages and proceed using professional standards. Your feedback must be structured, actionable, and evidence-based."

MarkdownTool Error Handling Implementation
To better support these optimized prompts, update your markdown tool implementation:
pythondef handle_markdown_error(section, error):
    fallback_sections = [
        "Brand Voice", 
        "Style Guide", 
        "Content Structure", 
        "Terminology Preferences",
        "Company Background",
        "Product Information",
        "Competitor Analysis"
    ]
    
    if section in fallback_sections:
        fallback_sections.remove(section)
    
    return {
        "status": "error",
        "message": f"Error accessing '{section}' section: {str(error)}",
        "fallback_options": fallback_sections,
        "recommendation": "Try accessing one of the fallback sections, or proceed using professional standards if all sections are inaccessible."
    }
These optimized prompts and tasks are specifically designed to work with your reference file structure, ensuring each agent knows exactly which sections to access and how to apply the information from each specific section. The sequential access pattern with clear error handling will significantly improve the reliability of your system.
